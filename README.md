# Plotly Project / Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive webpage that houses visual graphs and charts to showcase the data of each volunteer. 

## Resources
* JavaScript  
* HTML
* CSS
* D3.js 
* Bootstrap
* Data Sources: .js and .html files

## Summary of Results
This project presented significant opportunities to get creative with webpage enhancements. While the data is very straightforward and uncomplicated, the options for presentation are endless. Most of my time and effort was geared toward the final output and design of the webpage. 

The various methods of figures used illustrates the importance of giving people different ways to digest data. All three of the visuals are appropriately used to give the data more meaning without using long, cumbersome paragraphs.
